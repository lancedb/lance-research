 The open-source file formats have been widely adopted and proliferated for the past 10 years. 
 Apache Haddop first introduced two row-oriented formats, SequenceFile[@] and Avro[@]. Then Meta 
 released a column-oriented format for Hadoop called RCFile[@]. Shortly after that, Meta refined 
 RCFile to ORC (Optimized Record Columnar File) format [@]. Twitter and Cloudera andannounced
 the first version of parguet [@] 1 month after that. Ever since then, column-oriented file 
 formats become dominant in the big data ecosystems and they are supported by most data processing 
 platforms.

 Columnar file formats have been under active research and devlopment in recent years. Specifically 
 with the purpose to better serve a specific group of applications, such as computer vision, scientific 
 computations. There are scientific data storage formats for HPC workloads, including HDF5[@],BP5[@],
 NetCDF[@],and Zarr[@].They target heterogeneous data that has complex file structures,types, and 
 organizations.Their data is typically multi-dimensional arrays and not support column-wise encoding.

 Arrow represents the in-memory colmnar format designed for efficient exchange of data with limited 
 serialization between different application processs. Arrow can support random access thus it is a
 good candidate for long-term disk storage.

 Recent data storage solutions for AI tend to combine the data lake with data warehouse, such as the Delta
 Lake [@], Apache Iceberg[@] and Apache Hudi[@]. This requires a data format that not only can provide
 benefits such as efficient storage, performant access, but also can combine the metadata management.

 Another group of research goes into learning the column layouts given the workload knowledge and performance
 requirements[@Manos]. With a combination of OLAP and serving workloads[@procella2019], along with the underlying hardware, 
 making a priori decision of the dataset layout is suboptimal.  Tuning knobs such as how to physically order
 data, column density level and buffer space allocation for updates, can be decided for specific workloads.
