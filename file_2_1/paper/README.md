# Paper

This directory contains the latex / biblatex files for the paper itself. The paper is based on the
[VLDB template for Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-proceedings-of-the-vldb-endowment/krfrpvrbbvfj)

The `figures` directory contains a copy of files found elsewhere in this repository. This is primarily
because the paper was actually authored in Overleaf and the figures were uploaded there. However, it can
also be convenient to keep a distinct copy so that the plots can be edited and re-generated without
affecting the paper.

In addition, there is a built version of the paper at `paper.pdf`. This is the version that was submitted
to the conference.
